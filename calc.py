# write a program that asks the user to enter two
# numbers and the operator, and compute the result
# according the operator.
number1 = float(input('enter 1st number:'))

op = input('enter operator: ')
# addition
if op == '+':
    print(number1 + number2)
# subtraction
if op == '-':

# you can complete the code for * and / operators
